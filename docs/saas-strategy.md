## üìä PHASE 1: FOUNDATION - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 Professional Type System
**Goal**: Enable multiple professional categories without breaking existing surveyor functionality

**Database Evolution Strategy**:
```
Current: professionals.profession (single field)
Target: Flexible service-based architecture

New Structure:
- professional_types (master list)
- professional_services (what they offer)
- professional_service_areas (where they operate)
- professional_certifications (credentials)
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Keep existing surveyor data intact
- Use service tags instead of rigid categories
- Enable professionals to offer multiple services
- Support cross-professional collaboration

### 1.2 Service Catalog Architecture
**Components**:
- Service taxonomy (hierarchical)
- Service-specific requirements
- Pricing models per service
- Qualification criteria
- Document templates per service

**Modular Design**:
- Base professional interface
- Service-specific modules (plugins)
- Shared components library
- Service discovery mechanism

### 1.3 Enhanced Inquiry System
**Evolution Path**:
```
Current: Single inquiry type (survey)
Target: Multi-service request system

Changes:
- Inquiry templates per service
- Multi-professional requests
- Bundled service packages
- Dynamic form generation
```
