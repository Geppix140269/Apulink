## Critical Business Rules

### Financial
- Grant calculations: 45% of eligible renovation costs (Superbonus)
- Platform fee: 1% of property value (max €5,000) on completion
- Professional subscriptions: €49-299/month based on tier

### Security & Compliance
- All documents require authenticated access
- RLS policies enforce project-level permissions
- Audit trail maintained in `activity_log`
- Document versioning for legal compliance

### Team Management
- Only active team members can access project data
- Buyers control team invitations
- Professionals can decline/accept invitations
- Role-based permissions (view/edit/admin)

## Implementation Priorities

### Week 1: Make Dashboard Real
1. Connect existing UI to Supabase tables
2. Implement document upload to Storage
3. Create project CRUD operations
4. Set up real-time notifications

### Week 2: Professional Side
1. Build professional dashboard
2. Implement invitation system
3. Create quote/proposal workflow
4. Add messaging between users

### Week 3: Payments & Launch
1. Stripe subscription integration
2. Invoice generation
3. Email notifications (Resend)
4. Production deployment

## Technical Requirements

### For Each Table
- RLS policies for security
- Indexes on foreign keys
- Trigger for updated_at timestamps
- Proper constraints and validations

### Storage Buckets
- `project-documents`: Private bucket for legal docs
- `profile-images`: Public bucket for avatars
- `company-assets`: Public bucket for professional portfolios

### API Endpoints Needed
- `/api/projects` - CRUD operations
- `/api/documents/upload` - Secure file handling
- `/api/team/invite` - Professional invitations
- `/api/grants/calculate` - Grant estimations
- `/api/notifications/subscribe` - Real-time updates

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive documents at rest
- Implement 2FA for high-value accounts
- Regular backups of critical data
- GDPR compliance for EU users

### Business Continuity
- Document versioning prevents data loss
- Audit logs for dispute resolution
- Clear terms of service
- Professional liability insurance
