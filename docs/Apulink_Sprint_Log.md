## Session Wrap-Up & Handoff Document

### 📋 What We Accomplished Today (July 19, 2025)

1. **Identified Critical Homepage Issues**:
   - No clear path for professionals to register
   - Generic/cheap design with childish icons
   - Not capturing rich project details from buyers
   - Homepage doesn't convey Apulink as a professional services marketplace

2. **Design Evolution**:
   - Started with basic designs that were rejected as "childish"
   - Evolved to Mediterranean-inspired aesthetic from Midjourney images
   - Final design uses warm colors: #F5F2ED (beige), #D4A574 (terracotta), #8B9A7B (sage), #2C3E50 (charcoal)
   - Integrated Cloudinary video: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dbvghnclx/video/upload/v1752960658/geppix1402_81420_Homepage_concept_for_Apulink.com_a_modern_di_467a1d17-0990-46ea-b88e-7545ae48e598_3_mycs2i.mp4`

3. **Key Decisions Made**:
   - Use Midjourney-generated videos/images for premium feel
   - Cloudinary for media hosting
   - Sophisticated Mediterranean color palette (no blue!)
   - Focus on capturing detailed project information

### 🚀 For Next Session

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Create the complete homepage file with all sections

1. **Create Full Homepage Component**:
```typescript
// PATH: app/components/home/ApulinkHomepage.tsx
// Needs: 'use client' directive
// Include: Hero with video, How it Works, Services grid, Professional CTA, Footer
```

2. **Update app/page.tsx**:
```typescript
import ApulinkHomepage from './components/home/ApulinkHomepage'
export default function HomePage() {
  return <ApulinkHomepage />
}
```

3. **Sections Still Needed**:
   - How It Works (3-step process)
   - Services Grid (6 professional types)
   - Trust/Social Proof section
   - Professional Registration CTA
   - Footer with dual navigation

4. **Media Assets to Add**:
   - Upload more Midjourney videos to Cloudinary
   - Create image collages for service sections
   - Add professional headshots/testimonials
